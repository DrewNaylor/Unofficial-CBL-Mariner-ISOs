# Unofficial-CBL-Mariner-ISOs
Unofficial ISOs of CBL-Mariner built from stable releases. This repo is not associated with Microsoft and Microsoft does not endorse this project. CBL-Mariner itself is a trademark of Microsoft. All other copyrights and trademarks belong to their respective holders.

New ISOs will be built shortly after each new "Latest Version" release as published by Microsoft. I'm not going to build each tag as they may not all be stable.

You'll find the ISOs under the `Releases` page in the sidebar. Please see the official CBL-Mariner repo for more information on what it is: https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner

I made a video showing the process of building, installing, and trying to use CBL-Mariner, if you'd like to watch it:
